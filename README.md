# HelpOut
Our project, "HelpOut" is a telegram bot / channel that aims to provide assistance to those who are unwell and are unable to leave their 
homes, inspired by the current circuit breaker situation. Thus, we believe a little act of kindness can go a long way during such trying 
times. So why not a bot that allows people to volunteer to perform errands for the people in their community? With this, we have decided 
to implement a chatbot application. As telegram is one of the most used social media platforms, we settled on using a telegram bot. 

Programmes used:
  - Python
  - Python Telegram API
  - PhpMyAdmin
  - MySQL-connector

TelegramBot API in Python:

```$ pip install pyTelegramBotAPI```

MySQL connector

```C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts>python -m pip install mysql-connector```

PhpMyAdmin uses WAMP server (remote)

Commands:

    /start       : 'Get used to the bot',
    /help        : 'Gives you information about the available commands',
    /ask         : 'Type in your request',
    /status      : 'Check all your current requests',
    /done        : 'Changing status of request to completed',
    /delete      : 'Delete pending requests'
    
Limitations:
  - Has to be run on remote/local server
  - this goes the same for database
